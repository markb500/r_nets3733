        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>This app is intended for use as a supplemental revision aid in your preparation for the Electrical Principles exam. 
            It should be used alongside the practice questions provided in the training notes and in 
            consultation with your Tutor.</p>
            
        <h4>Instructions For Use</h4>
        <p>Choose a button from the left column for the subject you wish to revise. Each click will create 
            a new sum. Once you have completed your answer on paper, click the ‘solution’ button to see a 
            full, worked solution. A counter within the Solution button shows the number of times 
            the solution has been viewed. Note that, where calculations use the results from previous calculations, 
            the rounded figure is used.</p>
            
        <h4>Link To Training Notes</h4>
        <p>Under each question, a link is provided which will take you to the relevant area of the training notes.</p>
